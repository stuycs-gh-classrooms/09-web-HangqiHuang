		<h1>A Brief Introduction to G.E.M.</h1>
		<p>
		Many people have never heard of G.E.M., and that's absolutely intolerable. She is such a good singer and it is a shame that one shouldn't know of her. For this reason, this website is created to inform the uninformed of who is G.E.M. and why you should listen to her.
