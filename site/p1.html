				<p>
				"Light Years Away", by G.E.M. is one of her most, if not the most, internationally known song. This song is the Chinese theme song for the movie "Passengers" (2016) and has gained huge success both in China and around the world. The song sings of the power of love in times of crisis. Although our love may be insignificant compared to the vastness of the universe, but in this moment you are everything to me. Without you, nothing else matters. This song gained 227 million views on Youtube and G.E.M. got the chance to perform this song at the NASA Breakthrough Prize Ceremony of 2019.

				<p>
				"泡沫", literally translating to "Bubbles" was the start of G.E.M.'s career. It was first sang at <span class="italicize">I Am a Singer Season 2</span> and overnight it became viral on the Chinese Internet. Following this song, G.E.M. sang many more amazing songs at <span class="italicize">I Am a Singer</span> and this is how she became known in Mainland China. The song sings of love as being a bubble, able to pop any moment. But it's dazzling appearance still makes people want to believe in it. Therefore, no one's to blame in this lie except for the fact that this lie is too dazzling. If I were to be able to see through it in the beginning, there will be nothing to be sad about. Through its soft yet powerful rhythm, it reasonated with many people and reminded them of breakups that they experienced back when they actually believed in love.

				<img src="images/gem04.jpg" alt="cover page of the MV of "Long After"">
				<p>
				"Long After" is the theme song for the movie "Do You Love Me as I Love You" (2022). G.E.M. was invited to come up with the theme song for this movie; after watching the movie several times, she wrote the song and the lyrics. The song sings of a love without an ending. We were so in love back then and I did everything to make you stay. However, it didn't work out and now I just have to accept that you are gone. Maybe if I just wait, I will find someone better; but I'm afraid that I would never love as deep as I loved you. Long after, when I meet you again, I can only smile and wave. With its lyrics that move people to tears and the emotions that G.E.M. put into singing this song, it reminds people of the love that could have had an ending, but there is never any what-ifs.

				<img src="images/gem05.jpg" alt="cover page of the MV for "Miss Similar"">
				<p>
				"Miss Similar" is one of the few rap songs that G.E.M. has. The song is an adaptation of MC Hotdog's "Mr. Similar" with a new focus on women. The song sings of societal standards on women and how these standards are forced onto women. Women becomes assimilated into these standards and they lose their sense of self. In this song, G.E.M. also shares her experience of trying to lose weight to meet these standards. Through this, G.E.M. encourages women to be who they are and break free from societal standards.

				<p>
				"Still That Girl" was first sung at a music show that G.E.M. was invited to be the instructor of. The song sings of how the harsh reality slowly makes one lose hope in their dreams. What was once the whole purpose of living now became a joke. If that's the case, then I would rather be a sleeping beauty that never wakes up from my dream.
