				"Light Years Away", by G.E.M. is one of her most, if not the most, internationally known song. This song is the Chinese theme song for the movie "Passengers" (2016) and has gained huge success both in China and around the world. The song sings of the power of love in times of crisis. Although our love may be insignificant compared to the vastness of the universe, but in this moment you are everything to me. Without you, nothing else matters. This song gained 227 million views on Youtube and G.E.M. got the chance to perform this song at the NASA Breakthrough Prize Ceremony of 2019.
