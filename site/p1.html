				"Light Years Away", by G.E.M. is one of her most, if not the most, internationally known song. This song is the Chinese theme song for the movie "Passengers" (2016) and has gained huge success both in China and around the world. The song sings of the power of love in times of crisis. Although our love may be insignificant compared to the vastness of the universe, but in this moment you are everything to me. Without you, nothing else matters. This song gained 227 million views on Youtube and G.E.M. got the chance to perform this song at the NASA Breakthrough Prize Ceremony of 2019.

				<p>
				"泡沫", literally translating to "Bubbles" was the start of G.E.M.'s career. It was first sang at <span class="italicize">I Am a Singer Season 2</span> and overnight it became viral on the Chinese Internet. Following this song, G.E.M. sang many more amazing songs at <span class="italicize">I Am a Singer</span> and this is how she became known in Mainland China. The song sings of love as being a bubble, able to pop any moment. But it's dazzling appearance still makes people want to believe in it. Therefore, no one's to blame in this lie except for the fact that this lie is too dazzling. If I were to be able to see through it in the beginning, there will be nothing to be sad about. Through its soft yet powerful rhythm, it reasonated with many people and reminded them of breakups that they experienced back when they actually believed in love.
