		<h1>My Story with G.E.M.</h1>
		<h2>How I Came to Know G.E.M.</h2>
		<p>
		I first came to know G.E.M. because of the song "Light Years Away". For me, first time listening to that song amazed me quite a lot. The lyrics matched with what was going on in the movie (I didn't watch the movie but the MV gave a pretty good synopsis of what happened) and the way G.E.M. sang it really conveyed the message that even though love may be so insignificant compared to the complexity of life, it still holds a lot of power and value. Plus, an additional bonus was that the song was just right for my vocal range. I grew curious: who is this singer?
		</p>
		<p>
		In this age of mass info, everything could be discovered online. I did a quick Youtube search and Youtube brought me exactly where I wanted to be. I scrolled through the list of songs that G.E.M. published and very quickly I was captured. I was young at that time and didn't quite understand the message behind them, but that didn't stop me from appreciating the music.
		</p>
		<p>
		After that, I started regularly following up with G.E.M.'s releases. With every song that she published, I found her music to be better and better. She had some sort of magic that helped the listener actually feel the song instead of just listening to the song. I also started being attentive to what's happening with her in real life. I knew of her break with Hummingbird Music in 2019 and how she wrote the song "句号" (Period) to express how she felt about this event. She wrote numerous songs about her heartbreaks; when I first listened to them, little did I know that I would become the person in her song. I started watching her vlogs which gave me more insight to what kind of person she is. And through these many years, I acknowledged that she got both talent and a great personality to go along with it.
		</p>
		<p>
		I like G.E.M. not only because she is such a good singer, but also because many of her songs connect with me in a very personal way. For example, "再见" (Goodbye) taught me to not say goodbye because this might not be the last goodbye. "Long After" is a summary of my current state, not being able to let go because it could have worked out, but I fully know that there is no what-ifs. "Loneliness" portrays the other side of me that feels like no one understands me and I could only tell everything to myself. "Double Me" speaks to me about how I know I should let go but I can't let go, all the feelings that is pulling me apart. And lastly, "Man Who Laughs" speaks of me letting them leave with a smile on my face but how come they didn't see the tears in my eyes. Of course, there are many more examples, but you get the point.
		</p>
		<p>
		At the end, I wish G.E.M. the best of luck in her career and hope that she continue to grow and publish new songs. And I hope that I will continue to grow along with her and become a better person.
