	<h3>13-1: Energy, Phase Changes</h3>
	<p>
	Thermodynamics: study of heat (in chemistry terms, temp + energy)
	<ul>
		<li>Heat flws from high to low</li>
		<li>thermal energy is affected by temperature and mass</li>
	</ul>
		<li>	increase in temperature means increase in thermal energy</li>
		<li>	at constamp temperature, the substance with higher mass has higher thermal energy</li>
