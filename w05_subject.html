<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
G.E.M. is a music artist who grew up in Hongkong, China. When she was 15, she won the champion in a singing competition called "Spice It Up" and caught the attention of Chang Tan, who offered her a recording deal with Hummingbird Music. With the help of Hummingbird Music, she released many successful albums and became very successful. However, in 2019, she parted ways with Hummingbird Music, claiming that the company unfairly treated her. She became an independent singer and continued releasing songs. She is considered one of the most famous and successful Chinese singer. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.E.M.">Wikipedia</a> for more information.
